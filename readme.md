# Elytras of Fire Lib

## Welcome!

Elytras of Fire Lib is a Minecraft datapack used by other Elytras of Fire DLCs to function properly. Without it, these DLCs will not work at all, so make sure you have this downloaded!

This datapack does nothing solely on its own. If you are looking to use this alongside other datapacks that depend on this, [view a list of available DLCs here](#dlc-compatibility); if you would like to develop a DLC, [view this example pack](https://github.com/iHeronGH/DLC-Template) and read the documentation below.

## Installation and Uninstallation

[Back to top](#)

Installing Elytras of Fire Lib is relatively simple:

1. Download the datapack using the [Releases](https://github.com/iHeronGH/Elytras-of-Fire-Lib/releases) tab on the right (this will be populated when the datapack is in a releasable state, which it is not as of writing this.)
2. Open your world folder and place the downloaded folder into the "datapacks" folder.
3. Use **`/reload`** in-game to refresh your world. If you have installed it correctly, you will be met with a successful installation message. Thank you for using Elytras of Fire! I hope you enjoy it.

And uninstalling Elytras of Fire Lib is even simpler:

1. Run the command **`/function eoflib:uninstall`**. This will uninstall Elytras of Fire Lib along with all other dependent DLCs\*. And that's it!

    *\*Always double-check that your DLCs uninstalled correctly! Elytras of Fire Lib does its best to remove itself and its dependencies, but it's up to the developers of these DLCs that they are removed entirely. Contact the respective developers regarding incomplete uninstallation; unless it is an issue with Elytras of Fire Lib itself, I will not offer my assistance directly.*

<summary> View Advancements List </summary>

[Back to top](#)

#### eoflib:ability_used.json

**`ability_used.json`** is an advancement that is rewarded to players who have right-clicked their ability item — not necessarily activating said ability, but solely using the item. **`ability_used.json`** can be hooked into by adding your functions to your datapack's **`eoflib:reset/abilities.json`** function tag. Note that functions triggered via this advancement will activate one game tick after this advancement is rewarded to properly reset used abilities. **Do not overwrite/add the file to Elytras of Fire Lib.**

```json
{

```

#### minecraft:shulker_box.json

## Planned Features

[Back to top](#)

### Abilities Support

Arguably one of the most major parts of Elytras of Fire, ability support will be coming next! Currently there is minimal framework for ability support, but this is the next step in the development of Elytras of Fire Lib — and Elytras of Fire as a whole.

### Ability Blacklist

The Ability Blacklist is planned to exclude certain abilities from being granted to players. It is slated to deny abilities by type (primary, secondary, and tertiary), by tribe, and/or individually.

### Custom Death Messages

Custom Death Messages will be exactly that: custom death messages that will play when a player or named entity dies by a registered Elytras of Fire ability.

### Friendly Fire (A.K.A. Wings)

"Wings," in this instance, will refer to groups that users of Elytras of Fire can form; this can be most likened to factions found on Factions servers. Players that are a part of the same Wing will not be able to damage or negatively afflict one another via their abilities, and can invite up to 9 other players to their Wing.

### IMP Compliance

The following features of Elytras of Fire Lib are listed to prove [IMP compliance](https://github.com/Arcensoth/imp-spec), which are a set of suggested guidelines for Minecraft datapacks that ensure quality, compatibility, and optimal user and development experience.

> Core Standards: [Leave vanilla alone](https://github.com/Arcensoth/imp-spec/blob/master/docs/imp_core.md#1-leave-vanilla-alone)

The sole edit to Vanilla is the **`climbable`** block tag. There is currently no implementable workaround for this.

> Core Standards: [Namespace everything](https://github.com/Arcensoth/imp-spec/blob/master/docs/imp_core.md#2-namespace-everything)

All entity tags, custom items, scoreboard objectives, and storages used in Elytras of Fire use the following namespaces to clarify association with Elytras of Fire:

- **`eoflib`**
- **`eof`**

> Documentation: [Function headers](https://github.com/Arcensoth/imp-spec/blob/master/docs/imp_doc.md#function-headers)

All functions utilise the IMP-recommended header to the best of my ability. I do not guarantee 100% accuracy.

> Documentation: [Function annotations](https://github.com/Arcensoth/imp-spec/blob/master/docs/imp_doc.md#function-annotations)

All functions utilise the appropriate IMP-recommended annotations to the best of my ability. I do not guarantee 100% accuracy.
